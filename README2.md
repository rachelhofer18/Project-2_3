# Project 2 in the Books
## This last step or part of the Project 2 assignment was significantly
## easier for me.
### Instead of spending hours and hours on this project it only took me about two hours
### this go around. I think a big part of that is just that I am starting to understand
### all of the material better, and all of the concepts.
### Also once you start to understand some of the code and remembering the language it
### makes this class and learning how to build a webiste and how to code a lot easier.
#### I had a little bit of trouble linking the videos and finding a poster or image for
#### the video but after reading through the material and looking at examples I figured
#### it out. Also I finally added a bit of color to my website and am starting to learn
#### and figure out to link everything and make it so it all works together.
### The best news is, there were no tears with this homework and I am feeling much
### more confident in my work and this class. Thank goodness!
